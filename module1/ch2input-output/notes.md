# Chapter 2: Input, Processing, Output

## Designing a Program

Programs must be designed before they are written.

Design is the most important part of the program **development cycle**.
* Understand the task that the program is to perform
* Work with the customer to get a sense of what the program is supposed to do.
* Ask questions about program details.
* Create one or more software requirements.

### The Programming Development Cycle
1. Design the program
2. Write the code
3. Correct syntax errors
4. Test the program
5. Correct logic errors.

> When designing a program, developers usually use pseudocode and flowcharts.

### Pseudocode, Flowcharts

- Ovals are terminal symbols
- Parallelograms are input and output symbols
- Rectangles are processing symbols
- Symbols are connected by arrows that represent the flow of the program.
